### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]
A fun web app that plays YouTube music videos tailored to your current mood. To unlock the music, users play a balloon-popping mini-game that adds a playful challenge to brighten your day

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
Sometimes, choosing music for your mood feels like a chore. Wouldn't it be better if you had to earn your song by popping balloons? No? Well, now you do!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
We created a mood-based music player combined with a balloon-popping game to unlock songs. It makes music listening interactive and fun, combining mood vibes with a quick game break.
